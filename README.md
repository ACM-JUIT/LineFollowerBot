# LineFollowerBot
Codes for building a Line Follower Bot using I2C Master slave connection.

The following Bot follows a black line and navigates by itself. It also has indicator LEDs. Also it has an LED which shows when the BOT stops.

These are just the codes for Master and Slave Arduinos.
We have used arduino uno for this, but any arduino board would do just fine.

Documentation for connection can be found online and would also be updated in this repository very soon.
